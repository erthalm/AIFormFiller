# Privacy Policy – AI Form Filler (Chrome Extension)
**Effective date:** February 22, 2026

## 1) Overview (Single Purpose)
AI Form Filler helps users populate web form fields by retrieving relevant information from user-provided documents via the OpenAI API and inserting suggested values into form fields. The extension performs form-filling actions only when the user initiates them (for example, clicking “Fill Current Form” or a similar button).

## 2) Data We Handle
Depending on how you use the extension, it may handle the following categories of data:

### A) Authentication Information
- **OpenAI API Key:** Users may enter an OpenAI API key to enable API requests. The API key is stored locally in the user’s browser (Chrome storage) in encrypted form (AES-GCM) and is used only to authenticate requests to the OpenAI API.

### B) User-Provided Content
- **Documents/Files You Upload:** If users upload files through the extension, those files (and their contents) are transmitted to OpenAI API endpoints to enable document-based retrieval and form-filling. The extension does not upload files to any developer-controlled server.

### C) Website / Form Field Metadata (Limited Site Content)
- When the user triggers a fill action, the extension reads limited metadata from form fields on the current page (such as field label text, name/id attributes, placeholder text, field type, “required” indicators, and select options if applicable). This metadata may be sent to the OpenAI API to generate suggested values.

### D) Local Settings
- The extension stores local configuration (such as selected database/vector store identifiers, model/settings, and UI preferences) in Chrome storage so the user’s setup persists between sessions.

## 3) How We Use Data
We use the handled data only to:
- Provide the extension’s functionality (detect fillable fields and insert suggested values);
- Retrieve suggestions from the OpenAI API based on user-provided documents;
- Perform user-initiated document operations (for example, listing, uploading, updating, or deleting documents) via the OpenAI API;
- Provide support when users contact us (only if users choose to share information such as logs or screenshots).

## 4) Data Sharing / Transfers
- **OpenAI:** The extension sends data to OpenAI API endpoints (api.openai.com) when the user performs actions in the extension UI (for example, filling fields, uploading files, listing databases).
- **No sale of data:** We do not sell user data.
- **No unrelated use:** We do not use or transfer user data for purposes unrelated to the extension’s single purpose.
- **No creditworthiness/lending:** We do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending decisions.

## 5) Data Retention
- **Local storage:** The encrypted API key and configuration remain in the user’s browser until the user deletes them (for example, via extension settings, clearing extension storage, or uninstalling the extension).
- **OpenAI retention:** Any data transmitted to OpenAI (including uploaded files) is subject to OpenAI’s retention and deletion controls/policies. Users can delete uploaded files via the extension (if available) or via their OpenAI account/tools.

## 6) Security
- The extension stores the OpenAI API key locally in encrypted form (AES-GCM).
- Data sent to OpenAI is transmitted over HTTPS.
- We do not operate a separate developer backend to store user files or API keys.

## 7) User Choices and Controls
- **User initiation:** The extension sends requests to OpenAI only when the user initiates an action in the extension.
- **Delete local data:** Users can clear the extension’s local storage or uninstall the extension to remove locally stored settings.
- **Delete uploaded files:** Users can delete files via the extension (if the feature is present) or through OpenAI’s tools.

## 8) Changes to this Policy
We may update this policy as the extension evolves. We will update the “Effective date” and publish the revised version at the same URL.
